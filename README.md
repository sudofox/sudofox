# Hi, I'm Austin (sudofox)

![sudofox's GitHub stats][stats]

I build platforms, tools, and experiments that combine web development, system administration, and community features.  
Most of my work lives where **creative expression** meets **infrastructure problem-solving**.

## What I Work With
- **Backend:** PHP, Python, Perl, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Twig  
- **Systems:** Linux (RHEL/CentOS), Apache, NGINX, systemd, LVM, iptables, SELinux  
- **Ops & Hosting:** cPanel, Plesk, DNS, SSL, server monitoring, incident response  
- **Tooling:** Git, bash, SSH, automation, QA testing, regression analysis  
- **Experiments:** network infrastructure, telephony/VoIP labs, SDR and radio systems  

## Projects
- **[Sudomemo](https://www.sudomemo.net/)** — A global online Flipnote community for Nintendo DSi and 3DS  
- **[Flipnote Archive](https://archive.sudomemo.net/)** — A complete archive of every Flipnote posted to Flipnote Hatena  
- **Networking & Telephony Experiments** — Linux routers, VLANs, firewall tuning, Asterisk PBX, and PSTN/VoIP signaling  
- …plus plenty of smaller projects, utilities, and experiments  

## Beyond Tech
Outside of programming and infrastructure, I stay busy with:  
- Ham radio (KD8OUY), spectrum monitoring, and storm chasing / SKYWARN  
- Meteorology and emergency communications  
- Arts and crafts projects  
- Drink mixing and mixology  
- Writing and creative storytelling  

---

I enjoy blending **creative communities** with **deep technical work** — whether that’s hosting infrastructure, building backend systems, or experimenting with radios, weather, and art.
